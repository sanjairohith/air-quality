## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing air quality trends, identifying pollution hotspots, and building a predictive model for RSPM/PM10 levels. It follows a Design Thinking approach to ensure an effective and user-centered solution.

## Design Thinking Approach
We have adopted a Design Thinking methodology to guide our project through iterative problem-solving. Here are the key stages of our approach:

1. **Empathize**: Understand the needs and concerns of stakeholders, including environmental agencies, researchers, and the public.

2. **Define**: Clearly define the project objectives and create a problem statement that summarizes the core challenge.

3. **Ideate**: Brainstorm potential solutions and approaches to achieve the objectives.

4. **Prototype**: Develop a preliminary plan for the analysis approach, including data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

5. **Test**: Test the feasibility of the analysis approach using a small sample of data and gather feedback for refinement.

6. **Implement**: Begin full-scale implementation of the analysis approach, following the defined steps and continuously evaluating progress.

7. **Iterate**: Continuously evaluate and adjust the approach based on insights gained during implementation.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
- Analyze air quality trends over a specific time period.
- Identify pollution hotspots based on spatial analysis.
- Build a predictive model for RSPM/PM10 levels using data-driven techniques.

## Analysis Approach
Our analysis approach includes the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Collect air quality data from various sources, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and format the data, handle missing values and outliers, and perform necessary transformations.

3. **Data Analysis**: Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze air quality trends, identify pollution hotspots, and build predictive models.

## Visualization Selection
To effectively represent air quality trends and pollution levels, we will use a variety of visualization techniques, including but not limited to:
- Line charts to depict temporal trends in air quality.
- Heatmaps or GIS maps to highlight pollution hotspots.
- Interactive dashboards to facilitate data exploration and understanding.
